simple-codeigniter-image-upload-for-Redactor
============================================

Recently I working on a web application that needed to upload image within editor field, not a separated upload. 
So i found the solution by using Redactor from imperavi.

This is simple image uploader to integrated with Imperavi Redactor, but i have not finished yet create the plugin, 
so currently I only upload the controller which will handle upload process.

I will upload the plugin soon
