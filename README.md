simple codeigniter image upload for Redactor
============================================

Recently I working on a web application that needed to upload image within editor field, not a separated upload. 
So i found the solution by using Redactor from imperavi.

This is simple image uploader to integrated with Imperavi Redactor, but i have not finished yet create the plugin, 
so currently I only upload the controller which will handle upload process.

===========================================

I have upload it, under name of customimg.js, my code isn't clean enough I hope you understand how I written the code.

what's new?
1. this plugin isn't use default upload using drop file method, so we must select the file manually
2. this plugin isn't automatic upload, I use submit button to confirm the upload.
3. adding caption field for the image by some reason :p

===========================================

How to use it.

1. add script to your editor page
<script src="http://url.to/customimg.js"></script>

2. initilize the plugin to redactor init script

$('#content').redactor({
  plugins: ['customimg'],
});

3. add custom options to your image upload controllers

$('#content').redactor({
  plugins: ['customimg'],
  imageHandlers: './directory_to/image_upload',
});

4. And voila, the plugin ready to use
